This project was to originally record gaming clips at the press of button. 
Example: You get a PENTAKILL in LOL, but want to record yourself getting the PENTAKILL. You would use this web application to do record 15 seconds back. 

This project is very similar to what medail.tv already implements. I utilized MongoDB for video storing and node.js/express for api calls.
Unfortunately, this project was not successful as MongoDB is not fully optimized to handle video streaming; nonetheless, it was a great learning experience that introduced me to the complexity of video streaming and to streaming in nodejs.
