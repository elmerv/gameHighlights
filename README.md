This project was to originally record clips at the press of button. Similar to what medail.io already implements. I utilized MongoDB for video storing and node.js/express for api calls.
Unfortunately, this project was not successful as MongoDB is not fully optimized to handle video streaming; nonetheless, it was a great learning experience that introduced me to the complexity of video streaming and to streaming in nodejs.
